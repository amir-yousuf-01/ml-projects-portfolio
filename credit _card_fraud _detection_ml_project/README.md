💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Role: Data Scientist | Skills: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, XGBoost, Matplotlib

🔍 Project Overview
A machine learning–powered fraud detection system using anonymized credit card transaction data. The project aims to identify fraudulent activities with high accuracy despite extreme class imbalance, leveraging robust preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization techniques.

🚀 Key Contributions in Machine Learning
✅ 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
Analyzed 284,807 transactions to identify data skew and outliers.

Verified that most features (V1–V28) were PCA-transformed, requiring thoughtful handling and no label encoding.

Checked for missing values and ensured clean, consistent input.

⚖️ 2. Class Imbalance Handling
Detected high imbalance: fraud cases (~0.17%) vs. normal transactions.

Applied undersampling and used precision-recall trade-offs in evaluation to prevent model bias toward majority class.

📊 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created correlation matrices and boxplots to understand relationships between features and the target class.

Visualized fraud vs. normal patterns in transaction amounts and timing using seaborn and matplotlib.

🤖 4. Model Building
Trained several classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest) to compare performance.

Focused on:

Precision, Recall, F1-score (rather than Accuracy)

Confusion Matrix to evaluate true fraud detection

⚙️ 5. Model Optimization
Used GridSearchCV and cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters.

Chose XGBoost with tailored settings for best trade-off between recall and false positives.

Scaled features using StandardScaler to ensure optimal algorithm performance.

📌 Project Highlights
🛡️ Identified fraudulent transactions with high recall, crucial in real-world financial systems.

📉 Tackled severe class imbalance using resampling and weighted modeling techniques.

📈 Delivered clear and interactive visualizations to aid business understanding of fraud patterns.

🎯 Summary
This project demonstrates end-to-end capability in:

Fraud pattern analysis

Model deployment readiness

Responsible evaluation metrics (Precision-Recall focus)
