🧠 Synthetic Health Lifestyle Project
Role: Data Scientist | Skills: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly

🔍 Project Overview
A comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting chronic disease outcomes using synthetic health and lifestyle data. Demonstrated full-stack data science capabilities including data preprocessing, feature analysis, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

🚀 Key Accomplishments in Machine Learning
✅ 1. Predictive Modeling
Built an XGBoost classifier with a custom probability threshold (0.4) to enhance sensitivity in chronic disease prediction.

Achieved strong performance metrics, validated using confusion matrix and classification report.

🧹 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned missing data in Exercise Frequency and Alcohol Consumption by mode imputation.

Converted categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Diet) using label encoding to ensure model compatibility.

📊 3. Feature Engineering & Analysis
Performed correlation analysis using heatmaps (seaborn) to identify key drivers like BMI and lifestyle choices.

Engineered features that contributed to better model learning and outcome interpretation.

📈 4. Data Visualization
Created compelling visuals with seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly:

e.g., BMI distribution by gender, lifestyle vs. disease prevalence charts.

Enabled stakeholders to easily understand data trends and health risks.

⚙️ 5. Model Optimization
Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling.

Addressed class imbalance using scale_pos_weight=4.0 in XGBoost, leading to improved model fairness and performance.

🎯 Summary
Transformed raw health data into actionable insights through:

Robust ML pipeline development

Strategic feature selection

Advanced model tuning and evaluation
